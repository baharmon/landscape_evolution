% change in elevation (m) = elevation (m) - (change in time (s) / sediment mass density (kg/m^3) * gravitational diffusion coefficient (m^2/s) * divergence (m^-1))
%HM I have removed sed. mass density - to fix the units for diffusion coef, the sed density would be there is we 
% apply laplacian to sediment concentrations rather than elevation. Your original text did not have any variable.

%HM this should be \nabla^2 z, \nabla is an operator so there should be a variable upon which it is applied
%HM see eq 4.41 in Thaxton, also from Willgoose, the second term
