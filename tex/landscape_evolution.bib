We use a Green's function Monte Carlo method to solve the underlying continuity equations, leading to improved robustness and implementation efficiency. By deriving the relationship between the terrain shape and erosion/deposition pattern, we clarify the physical interpretation of terrain curvatures and overall importance of the bivariate formulation. We explain the impact of various soil and cover properties by simulating the detachment and transport capacity limited erosion for uniform land use and by predicting the erosion/deposition distribution for a conventional, spatially variable land use at an experimental farm. We compare the results with the observed colluvial deposits and linear erosion features and illustrate the application of the model for improving the effectiveness of erosion prevention measures.},

This paper reviews some of the aspects of the disciplines of geomorphology and ecosystems ecology, and the papers presented at the symposium. The papers in this volume illustrate the current status of the disciplines, the difficulties in bridging the disciplines, and the issues that are emerging as research priorities.},

@book{Temme2013,
abstract = {This chapter reviews quantitative modeling of landscape evolution – which means that not just model studies but also modeling concepts are discussed. Quantitative modeling is contrasted with conceptual or physical modeling, and four categories of model studies are presented. Procedural studies focus on model experimentation. Descriptive studies use models to learn about landscapes in general. Postdictive and predictive try to correctly simulate the evolution of real landscapes, respectively in the past (with calibration) or in the future (with calibrated models). The geomorphic process is a central concept in landscape evolution modeling. We discuss problems with the field-based definition of these processes from a modelling perspective. After the classification of 117 landscape evolution studies in these categories, we find that descriptive studies are most common, and predictive studies are least common. In the remainder of the chapter, we list and review the 117 studies. In procedural studies, attention has been focussed at production methods for digital landscapes, spatial resolution and the role of sinks and depressions. Descriptive studies focussed mainly on surface–tectonic interactions, sensitivity to external forcing, and the definition of crucial field observations from model results. Postdictive and predictive studies operate mainly in time-forward mode and are sometimes validated (postdictive studies of soil redistribution over centennial to millennial timescales). Finally, we look ahead to the future of landscape evolution modeling, arguing for a larger role for complexity research, predictive studies and uncertainty analysis, process definition and feedbacks to and from other fields (including ecology).},

abstract = {The mathematical modeling of landform evolution consists of two components: the processes represented (i.e., considered dominant) in the model and the (typically computer) model representation of these processes. This review discusses the current debates surrounding processes represented in landform evolution. The potential impact on both evolving landforms and computer model structure is discussed. Issues specifically discussed include (a) the fundamental nature of mass conservation and the role of detachment- and transport-limited processes in mass conservation equations, (b) the interaction between detachment- and transport-limitation in channels, (c) the role of hillslope erosion and soil properties and their interaction with channel processes, (d) the interactions with tectonics when applying these models at large scale, (e) depositional structures and implications for paleo-climatic interpretation, (f) engineering applications of these models, and (g) numerical issues in the computer implementations. This review is not a model comparison. However, many applications are at the boundaries of computer capabilities so a comparison of existing models is provided.},

 abstract = {Archaeology has an opportunity to offer major contributions to our understanding of the long-term interactions of humans and the environment. To do so, we must elucidate dynamic socioecological processes that generally operate at regional scales. However, the archaeological record is sparse, discontinuous, and static. Recent advances in computational modeling provide the potential for creating experimental laboratories where dynamic processes can be simulated and their results compared against the archaeological record. Coupling computational modeling with the empirical record in this way can increase the rigor of our explanations while making more transparent the concepts on which they are based. We offer an example of such an experimental laboratory to study the long-term effects of varying landuse practices by subsistence farmers on landscapes, and compare the results with the Levantine Neolithic archaeological record. Different combinations of intensive and shifting cultivation, ovicaprid grazing, and settlement size are modeled for the Wadi Ziqlab drainage of northern Jordan. The results offer insight into conditions under which previously successful (and sustainable) landuse practices can pass an imperceptible threshold and lead to undesirable landscape consequences. This may also help explain long-term social, economic, and settlement changes in the Neolithic of Southwest Asia.},

abstract = {This study is a compilation of vascular flora data from previous reports and current findings from 1965 through 2003 of Fort Bragg Military Reservation and Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve, located in the Sandhills region of North Carolina. Vascular plants are divided into four major groups: Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms (monocots) and Angiosperms (dicots). Reported for the study area are 143 families, 490 genera, and 1,206 species and infraspecific taxa, of which 203 (16.8{\%}) are alien or adventive. Sixty one species are rare, of which three are federally endangered: Lysimachia asperulifolia, Rhus michauxii, and Schwalbea americana. The following five species are currently known in North Carolina only from study area populations: Carex tenax, Hypericum fasciculatum, Pteroglossaspis ecristata, Rhynchospora crinipes, and Warea cuneifolia. This study documents the importance of Fort Bragg Military Reservation and Weymouth Woods Preserve in contributing to the floristic diversity of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem.},

abstract = {The study of military training on Army installations focuses extensively on vehicle impact, and foot traffic impact is not well documented. At the US Military Academy, West Point, NY, foot traffic impact was modeled using three functions (logistical growth, Gamma, and Wiebull) and field and laboratory data. The modeled data were compared to the actual condition of the soil in the Bataan Bayonet Assault Course, indicating a moderate level of compaction at the end of summer training. Bulk density, mean infiltration rates, and soil resistance were also compared, also indicating a moderate impact on soil compaction. The average infiltration rate decreased while the bearing capacity increased during the training cycle. The results indicate that the soil recovers moderately during the subsequent freeze-thaw cycle. This model has potential for greater application for predicting soil conditions.},

@incollection{Huang2014,
abstract = {Gullies are common features throughout the southwestern United States including Army training facilities such as the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. These gullies have depths up to several meters, which can restrict the mobility of troops and vehicles during training exercises. They also have the potential to grow in size, which can degrade training lands. At the upstream end, gullies usually begin with an abrupt headwall, and in the downstream direction, gullies also tend to terminate abruptly. In this paper, we hypothesize that the small extent of convective storms and significant transmission losses in channels promote the downstream disappearance of gullies. The role of these factors is tested by applying a geomorphic model in which storms occur within circular portions of the simulation domain and channel flow is lost to seepage up to a specified infiltration or seepage capacity in each grid cell. The net effect of these processes is to reduce the sediment transport capacity in the downstream direction relative to the case with an infinite storm size and no channel losses. The reduced sediment capacity alters the relationship between slope and drainage area for topographies at equilibrium. In addition, limited storm sizes can also produce disconnected areas of incision within generally depositional portions of the landscape.},
