abstract = {We present a bivariate model of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition by overland flow, designed for complex terrain, soil, and cover conditions. We use a Green's function Monte Carlo method to solve the underlying continuity equations, leading to improved robustness and implementation efficiency. By deriving the relationship between the terrain shape and erosion/deposition pattern, we clarify the physical interpretation of terrain curvatures and overall importance of the bivariate formulation. We explain the impact of various soil and cover properties by simulating the detachment and transport capacity limited erosion for uniform land use and by predicting the erosion/deposition distribution for a conventional, spatially variable land use at an experimental farm. We compare the results with the observed colluvial deposits and linear erosion features and illustrate the application of the model for improving the effectiveness of erosion prevention measures.},

Over the past few decades, a proliferation of research has developed at the interface of geomorphology and ecosystems ecology. The 2005 Binghamton Symposium brought together some of the leading researchers from both communities to address these critical interfaces between the disciplines. This paper reviews some of the aspects of the disciplines of geomorphology and ecosystems ecology, and the papers presented at the symposium. The papers in this volume illustrate the current status of the disciplines, the difficulties in bridging the disciplines, and the issues that are emerging as research priorities.},

@book{Temme2013,
abstract = {This chapter reviews quantitative modeling of landscape evolution – which means that not just model studies but also modeling concepts are discussed. Quantitative modeling is contrasted with conceptual or physical modeling, and four categories of model studies are presented. Procedural studies focus on model experimentation. Descriptive studies use models to learn about landscapes in general. Postdictive and predictive try to correctly simulate the evolution of real landscapes, respectively in the past (with calibration) or in the future (with calibrated models). The geomorphic process is a central concept in landscape evolution modeling. We discuss problems with the field-based definition of these processes from a modelling perspective. After the classification of 117 landscape evolution studies in these categories, we find that descriptive studies are most common, and predictive studies are least common. In the remainder of the chapter, we list and review the 117 studies. In procedural studies, attention has been focussed at production methods for digital landscapes, spatial resolution and the role of sinks and depressions. Descriptive studies focussed mainly on surface–tectonic interactions, sensitivity to external forcing, and the definition of crucial field observations from model results. Postdictive and predictive studies operate mainly in time-forward mode and are sometimes validated (postdictive studies of soil redistribution over centennial to millennial timescales). Finally, we look ahead to the future of landscape evolution modeling, arguing for a larger role for complexity research, predictive studies and uncertainty analysis, process definition and feedbacks to and from other fields (including ecology).},

abstract = {The mathematical modeling of landform evolution consists of two components: the processes represented (i.e., considered dominant) in the model and the (typically computer) model representation of these processes. This review discusses the current debates surrounding processes represented in landform evolution. The potential impact on both evolving landforms and computer model structure is discussed. Issues specifically discussed include (a) the fundamental nature of mass conservation and the role of detachment- and transport-limited processes in mass conservation equations, (b) the interaction between detachment- and transport-limitation in channels, (c) the role of hillslope erosion and soil properties and their interaction with channel processes, (d) the interactions with tectonics when applying these models at large scale, (e) depositional structures and implications for paleo-climatic interpretation, (f) engineering applications of these models, and (g) numerical issues in the computer implementations. This review is not a model comparison. However, many applications are at the boundaries of computer capabilities so a comparison of existing models is provided.},

 abstract = {Archaeology has an opportunity to offer major contributions to our understanding of the long-term interactions of humans and the environment. To do so, we must elucidate dynamic socioecological processes that generally operate at regional scales. However, the archaeological record is sparse, discontinuous, and static. Recent advances in computational modeling provide the potential for creating experimental laboratories where dynamic processes can be simulated and their results compared against the archaeological record. Coupling computational modeling with the empirical record in this way can increase the rigor of our explanations while making more transparent the concepts on which they are based. We offer an example of such an experimental laboratory to study the long-term effects of varying landuse practices by subsistence farmers on landscapes, and compare the results with the Levantine Neolithic archaeological record. Different combinations of intensive and shifting cultivation, ovicaprid grazing, and settlement size are modeled for the Wadi Ziqlab drainage of northern Jordan. The results offer insight into conditions under which previously successful (and sustainable) landuse practices can pass an imperceptible threshold and lead to undesirable landscape consequences. This may also help explain long-term social, economic, and settlement changes in the Neolithic of Southwest Asia.},

At the US Military Academy, West Point, NY, foot traffic impact was modeled using three functions (logistical growth, Gamma, and Wiebull) and field and laboratory data. The modeled data were compared to the actual condition of the soil in the Bataan Bayonet Assault Course, indicating a moderate level of compaction at the end of summer training. Bulk density, mean infiltration rates, and soil resistance were also compared, also indicating a moderate impact on soil compaction. The average infiltration rate decreased while the bearing capacity increased during the training cycle. The results indicate that the soil recovers moderately during the subsequent freeze-thaw cycle. This model has potential for greater application for predicting soil conditions.},

abstract = {Gullies are common features throughout the southwestern United States including Army training facilities such as the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. These gullies have depths up to several meters, which can restrict the mobility of troops and vehicles during training exercises. They also have the potential to grow in size, which can degrade training lands. At the upstream end, gullies usually begin with an abrupt headwall, and in the downstream direction, gullies also tend to terminate abruptly. In this paper, we hypothesize that the small extent of convective storms and significant transmission losses in channels promote the downstream disappearance of gullies. The role of these factors is tested by applying a geomorphic model in which storms occur within circular portions of the simulation domain and channel flow is lost to seepage up to a specified infiltration or seepage capacity in each grid cell. The net effect of these processes is to reduce the sediment transport capacity in the downstream direction relative to the case with an infinite storm size and no channel losses. The reduced sediment capacity alters the relationship between slope and drainage area for topographies at equilibrium. In addition, limited storm sizes can also produce disconnected areas of incision within generally depositional portions of the landscape.},

abstract = {With the advent of the innovative techniques for generating high temporal and spatial resolution terrain models from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery, it has become possible to precisely map overland flow patterns. Furthermore, the process has become more affordable and efficient through the coupling of small UAS (sUAS) that are easily deployed with Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms that can efficiently derive 3D data from RGB imagery captured with consumer grade cameras. We propose applying the robust overland flow algorithm based on the path sampling technique for mapping flow paths in the arable land on a small test site in Raleigh, North Carolina. By comparing a time series of five flights in 2015 with the results of a simulation based on the most recent lidar derived DEM (2013), we show that the sUAS based data is suitable for overland flow predictions and has several advantages over the lidar data. The sUAS based data captures preferential flow along tillage and more accurately represents gullies. Furthermore the simulated water flow patterns over the sUAS based terrain models are consistent throughout the year. When terrain models are reconstructed only from sUAS captured RGB imagery, however, water flow modeling is only appropriate in areas with sparse or no vegetation cover.},

abstract = "Change detection of high resolution topographic data is commonly used in river valleys to quantify reach- and site-scale sediment budgets by estimating the erosion/deposition volume, and to interpret the geomorphic processes driving erosion and deposition. Field survey data are typically collected as point clouds that are often converted to gridded raster datasets and the ultimate choice of grid resolution is left to the user. This choice may have important implications for both the quantification and interpretation of geomorphic change. Here we used concurrent topographic data collected by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to quantify the influence of grid resolution and sampling technique on (a) the sediment budget and (b) the presence and role of geomorphic processes (i.e., alluvial, colluvial, aeolian, and fluvial transport) driving topographic change at four sites along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. We found that while both techniques produced similar estimates for site-scale sediment budgets, the magnitude of detected topographic change was dampened at coarser pixel resolutions. An overall decrease in the areal extent of erosion and deposition were observed, respectively, when coarsening pixel size from 5cm to 1m among all sites. Coarser resolution data tended to affect interpretation of landscape change along the margins of river valleys. For example, when changing from 5cm to 1m pixel resolution, the inferred contribution of aeolian changes to total site-scale geomorphic change increased in area by 7.9%, whereas the inferred contribution of alluvial and colluvial processes decreased in area by 97.9% and 88.2%, respectively. More generally, we found that coarsening pixel sizes disproportionately attributed geomorphic change to one or more of the most common processes operating at a site. We also found that coarsening pixel resolution amplified the net sediment imbalance at the site scale, driving the imbalance at erosional sites further into erosion and vice versa for depositional sites. Our results have implications both for point cloud data collection and for raster dataset processing. We argue that selecting the finest obtainable resolution is not always warranted to accurately quantify and interpret geomorphic change, because remote sensing technique, topographic data resolution, and analysis procedure can be optimized to capture the spatial scale of those processes driving landscape change. However, in landscapes at or near sediment equilibrium (i.e., equal amounts of erosion and deposition), the finest obtainable topographic data resolution is warranted to avoid amplifying sediment imbalance and erroneously inferring that sites are trending toward erosion or deposition."

Although gully erosion intensity is highly impacted by catchment area changes, few studies have focused on the relevant mechanisms. This study presents a new approach to studying this issue by combining historic aerial photography and recent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery to determine changes in gully morphology over 40 years on China's Loess Plateau, one of the world's most erosion-prone regions. Aerial photographs from 1976 were matched with UAV imagery taken in 2017 to compare gully and surface conditions in two study areas over time. Next, a new method was developed for calculating changes in gully volume and erosion moduli based on the UAV-derived digital surface model. Finally, the impacts of catchment area change on gully erosion moduli over the study period were analyzed. The results showed that the catchment areas decreased by 0.71–77.88%; greater decreases resulted in lower gully erosion moduli (with an exponential correlation) and reducing catchment area effectively slowed gully development. In addition, regional agricultural terrace construction has reduced the catchment areas, in turn reducing the amount of runoff entering gullies and thus reducing incision. Therefore, the management and maintenance of abandoned terraces should be strengthened by local governments and stakeholders to reduce runoff-induced gully erosion and sediment loss from upslope areas. The methodologies and results of this study have the potential to provide significant scientific references for the conservation of runoff and sediment in erosion-prone regions of China and elsewhere."

It is often difficult to quantify the loss of soil because the footprint of individual gullies is too small to be captured by most generally available digital elevation models (DEMs), such as the USGS National Elevation Dataset. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has the potential to provide the required data density, but an even newer class of ground-based sensors may provide better local resolution at lower cost. In this study, we compared digital elevation models produced by airborne and ground-based LiDAR systems with ground-based geomorphic and geodetic survey data to determine their utility in quantifying volumetric soil loss due to gully erosion in a heavily degraded watershed (7.55×10−2km2), on southwestern Santa Cruz Island in southern California. Volumetric estimates of the eroded sediment were produced by comparing the LiDAR-derived DEMs of the gully system to a modeled pre-erosion surface. Average point densities were significantly higher for the ground-based LiDAR system and provided more detailed information; however, its limited scanning footprint and side-looking orientation presented serious challenges in collecting continuous data from deeply incised gullies, making the airborne system preferable for this type of investigation and likely for most applications where heavy topographic shadowing is prevalent."

abstract = "Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technology is a powerful tool for quantifying gully morphology and monitoring change over time. This is due to the high sampling density, sub-centimetre positional accuracies (x, y, z), flexibility of survey configurations and ability to link multiple TLS scans together. However, to ensure correct interpretation of results, research is needed to test the repeatability of TLS derived products to quantify the accuracy and separate ‘false’ from ‘true’ geomorphic change. In this study, we use the RIEGL VZ400 scanner to test the repeatability of TLS datasets for mapping gully morphology. We then quantify change following a rainfall event of approximately 100mm. Our study site, located in south-east Queensland, Australia was chosen to be challenging from a repeatability perspective with high topographic variability. The TLS data capture involved three sets of linked scans: one survey pre-rainfall, to be compared to two surveys post-rainfall acquired on consecutive days. Change is considered negligible in the two post-rainfall scans to test survey repeatability. To verify TLS accuracy, an independent dataset of gully extent and spot heights were acquired using traditional total station techniques. Results confirm that the TLS datasets can be registered multi-temporally at sub-centimetre levels of accuracy in three dimensions. Total station and TLS elevation samples showed strong agreement with a mean error and standard deviation (SD) of residuals equal to 0.052 and 0.047m, respectively (n=889). Significantly, our repeatability tests found that return type and pulse deviation influence the accuracy and repeatability of DEMs in gully environments. Analysis of consecutive day datasets showed that DEMs derived from first return data recorded 40% higher SD of residual error than DEMs using multiple return data. A significant empirical relationship between pulse deviation and the variance of residuals for repeat DEMs is also shown (r2=0.95). By accounting for pulse deviation, we demonstrate that a spatially variable change detection threshold increased the geomorphic change detected following the rainfall event. Overall, this work supports TLS as a tool for monitoring change in gully morphology; however, consideration of the survey configuration is needed to maximise the change detected and ensure repeatability of results."

Terrestrial laser scanning units have evolved into a common tool in studies of spectral and structural geology, seismology, natural hazards, geomorphology, and glaciology. Special consideration of the advantages and limitations of TLS in each of these fields is discussed in depth in the context of important work published in each field. The workflow used in a TLS survey is crucial to the success of the survey, and field-specific Earth science workflows are therefore also discussed. Products based on TLS data, such as triangulated irregular networks (TIN) and digital surface models (DSM), are commonplace tools throughout the Earth sciences and the use of these tools to measure slip distributions, fault geometries, aeolian transport, river bed morphologies and flows, and other research problems is expanded on where appropriate. The review concludes with a discussion of recent trends in TLS instrument development and their potential impact on the use of TLS in the Earth sciences in the future."

abstract = {This work investigates the effects of modifying the runoff production mechanism used in the Willgoose-Bras-Rodiguez-Iturbe basin evolution model from Hortonian to subsurface saturation. The modified model also simulates basins that reproduce well common geomorphological statistics. This result confirms the ability of the model to adapt to different hydrological environments. The most important difference between the original and the modified model appears in the evolution of the hypsometric curve, particularly in the transition between saturated and unsaturated nodes. The role of mass movement due to diffusive processes (such as rain splash and rock slides) is more significant in the modified model due to decreased role of wash in unsaturated regions. A measure is developed to quantify the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions. Evolutions were found to separate in time following a power law, explaining the apparent randomness present in catchments simulated with only slight perturbations in their initial conditions. This apparent randomness is the result of the weakly chaotic features of the model.}
