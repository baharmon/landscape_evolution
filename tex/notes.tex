Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill 

Blaney and Gilead loamy sands

%The Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill type covers dry longleaf pine communities that are less
%xeric and infertile than the Xeric Sandhill Scrub type, and are characterized by a scrub oak layer
%containing a mixture of oak species. The Blackjack Subtype covers examples where Quercus
%marilandica is a significant component. They are associated with soils having clay below a
%sandy surface. These are common in the Sandhills region but occur only occasionally in other
%parts of the Coastal Plain.
