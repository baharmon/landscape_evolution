# r.watershed
* add depression parameter to r.watershed
* derive from landcover class

# questions
* can m and n be derived?
- m as a function of landcover (lower with veg)
- n as a function of slope
- see Renard 1994 for m & n
- from soil, slope, shear stress, or detach / trans coefficient?
* default params for m and n?
- rusle3d m = 0.2-0.6, n = 1-1.3
- upsed m = 1-1.6, n = 1-1.3
