NOTE: Sediment bulk density = sediment mass density (kg/m3) * bed porosity (dimensionless)

Exner Equation
the terrain evolution equation used in this treatment is (e.g. Willgoose et al., 1991; Lei et al., 1997):
( 4 . 4 1 )
(4.42)
r
∂z(r,t)1r(rr rr)
= − r ∇ ⋅ q ( r , t ) s$ ( r , t ) − ε ( r ) ∇ z ( r , t )
  ρ (r) b
∂t
where Db(r) [kg/m3] is the bulk density of the sediment
ρb(r)= ρs(1−λ(r))
s0g
Here, ρs [kg/m3] is the density of the sediment and λ(r) [dimensionless] is the bed porosity. The diffusion coefficient, εg(r) [m2/s], and the bulk density can vary spatially depending on the soil type.
